# Simple_ETL
The purpose of this project is to covers the entire ETL process based on Spotify API data. 

I am going to build a simple data pipeline (or in other words, a data feed) that downloads Spotify data on what songs I've listened to in the last 24 hours, and saves that data in a SQLite database.

I will schedule this pipeline to run daily. After a few months I will end up with our own, private Spotify played tracks history dataset!
